> <styan> xq: When using torsocks(1) on kristall QNetworkInterface complains loudly about not being permitted to create an IPv6 socket..

MAC needs different default font:

<styan> xq: Also, Kristall still compilers on my FreeBSD laptop.  And still core-dumps if it is compiled while LibreSSL is installed (not a Kristall problem, just a QT problem).
